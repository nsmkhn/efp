# Efficient File Parsing
Given a file whose name is passed as an argument to a program. Count the number of distinct unique words in it.<br>

## Constraints
- File is guaranteed to contain only 'a'..'z' and space characters in ASCII encoding.
- Should be able to handle large inputs (e.g. 32 GiB).
- You can assume that all unique words fit into memory when using the data structure of your choice.
- The solution must utilize all available CPU resources.

## Quick Start
```console
$ make -Bj
$ ./efp <file>
```
